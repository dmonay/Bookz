# Bookz

I need to convert my grandma's books from fb2, epub, and other formats to Mobi. This helps with that.

Currently uses [Calibre](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/faq.html). 

TODOs
  - add a status indicator
  - add tests
  - add benchmarks
  - rewrite Calibre's python conversion logic in Go and remove dependency
